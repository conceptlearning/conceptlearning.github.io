Our tutorial will run for three and a half hours + a thirty-minute break.
We will start at 14:00 and conclude around 18:00.
Below is the expected schedule for this tutorial where we indicate next to each
section who will be presenting that section's material
(MEZ for "Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga" and PB for "Pietro Barbiero").
